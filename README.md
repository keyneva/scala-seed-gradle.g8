# scala-seed-gradle

This Giter8 template is a merge of the alternative seed projects generated by the following commands in order to eventually create a Scala _application_ using `gradle` as builder tool:

Create Scala _library_ using `gradle` as builder tool:

```bash
gradle init --type scala-library --dsl groovy
```

Create Java _application_ using `gradle` as builder tool:

```bash
gradle init --type java-application --dsl groovy
```

Create Scala _application_ using `sbt` as builder tool:

```bash
sbt new scala/scala-seed.g8
```

## Getting Started

Create Scala _application_ using `gradle` as builder tool:

```bash
sbt new oktadigital/scala-seed-gradle.g8
```

Then add the gradle wrapper:

```bash
